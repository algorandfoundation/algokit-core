# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section contains Architecture Decision Records documenting important decisions made during the development of AlgoKit Core.

## Contents

- **[0000: Native Implementations vs FFI](./0000-native-implementations-vs-ffi.md)** - Decision on implementation strategy for multi-language support

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

- **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context** - The situation or problem
- **Decision** - What we decided to do
- **Consequences** - The results of the decision

## Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially starting from 0000. When adding a new ADR:

1. Use the next available number
2. Include a descriptive title
3. Follow the standard format
4. Update this README

## Purpose

ADRs help us:

- Remember why we made certain decisions
- Avoid relitigating settled questions
- Onboard new team members quickly
- Learn from past decisions

## Living Documents

While decisions should be stable, ADRs can be updated to:

- Fix typos or improve clarity
- Add new consequences discovered over time
- Mark decisions as superseded by newer ADRs
