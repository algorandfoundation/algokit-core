# OpenAPI Specs for algorand apis

## Algod

The `algod.oas2.json` is taken directly from [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/blob/master/daemon/algod/api/algod.oas2.json), then it was manually converted to OpenAPI 3.0.0 via [swagger converter](https://converter.swagger.io/), then manually edited to pass linting in redocly cli.
